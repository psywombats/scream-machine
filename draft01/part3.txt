A broadcast is on TV. A panel of experts is discussing the one year anniversary of the Mission St. disappearances and the lack of leads.

SKETCH: "Theroux?"
SKETCH: "Theroux, respond. if you can see these. you must respond."
SKETCH: "Theroux?"
SKETCH: "Never mind. I must assume you are a plant."
SKETCH: "If on some chance you aren't. You must leave. Let the temple alone."
YOU: "sorry, I was asleep"
YOU: "what are you talking about? is this about Elle?"
SKETCH: "You posted this morning to the wolfe-BBS system. Related to an account named THEROUX. I'm not stupid. If you were wondering."
YOU: "what do you know about her, Elle?"
SKETCH: "I know nothing. Except that this is a dead end. The temple is a dead end. You understand that? Theroux?"
YOU: "I don't have any idea"
SKETCH: "You do. You're one of them? Aren't you? The cult? The gate? Orion?"
SKETCH: "Obviously. Obviously!"
SKETCH: "What is Vertigo Temple? Who and where are they?"
YOU: "no idea what you're talking about"
SKETCH: "then you cannot have known AppleWhite."
YOU: "Elle Applewhite? fake name but she was my sister"
SKETCH: "Do not care who she was. It was a pseudonym. Who knows what relation to that hellworld she inherited. Surely you don't remember. Can't recall. UnderStand?"
SKETCH: "You can't understand. If you did you'd be one of them by now."
YOU: "I have no idea what you're after"
YOU: "hello?"

PARTNER: "Hey hey. Just figured I'd get in touch this morning to call you an absolute moron."
YOU: "uhm say what?"
PARTNER: "what in the everloving fuck were you thinking, posting to wolfe.bbs?"
PARTNER: "Control's a genius so she can waltz around there doing whatever she wants, but don't get any ideas, don't go using on that site"
YOU: "I never posted there"
YOU: "I read what Control wrote but I didn't write anything"
PARTNER: "just how exactly out of it WERE you last night?"
PARTNER: "like I know you didn't find much on your end except for that video of the founder"
PARTNER: "but that's no reason to kill yourself is it?"
YOU: "??? I haven't killed myself"
PARTNER: "because posting your phone # on that place is basically asking for ugly people to show up and club you over the head"
YOU: "kind of think that would be obvious"
PARTNER: "plenty of suicide cases walking the streets these days. we're after Elle, aren't we?"
PARTNER: "...no offense. I still don't know if she was a suicide or not. or if she got caught up with her stalkers. or if her stalkers were her true partners?"
PARTNER: "I don't know"
YOU: "what is this about me on the bbs? wolfe?"
PARTNER: "someone posted a question looking for info on a name. not gonna type it out here. but it's strange. just saying"
PARTNER: "if you swear it wasn't you, check on the bbs. wolfe.bbs.ne"

ANON: "'LAMER!' Nice to meet you Officer Donuts. How is work today?"
ANON: "anyone got a robodialler?"
ANON: "I think OP must be feeling a little lonely"
ANON: "lol hope to god this is a bad troll because otherwise you're gonna get the wrong kind of attention posting that here. You shouldn't know that name until the very end."

YOU: "hey did you post my number on that info site?"
CONTROL: "On Wolfe? What ever are you talking about?"
YOU: "well someone did. I'm getting crank message already, something about Vertigo Temple"
CONTROL: "Hmmm that's kind of a familiar name. Let me load the site, one moment."

RANDOM: "heya! pretty bold putting your number out there sweetie?"
YOU: "do I know you?"
RANDOM: "give me a good time, gorgeous. what do you say? I bet you're smexy as hell."
-- blocked

CONTROL: "Haha, this is quite the nasty prank someone's pulled on you."
CONTROL: "Have you made any enemies recently?"
YOU: "not that I know of"
CONTROL: "I can get in touch with some Wolfe friends and see if it's possible to backtrace who actually posted it."
CONTROL: "You didn't actually post it, did you?"
YOU: "of course not"
CONTROL: "Goood. Don't think of betraying us. Everything will be fine as long as you work with me and follow my instructions."
YOU: "you said the name Vertigo Temple sounded familiar?"
CONTROL: "Hmm, yes, in a vague way. We might've had a job with them once."
CONTROL: "I think it was one of the milleniary cults that were popular when Y2K was a thing."
CONTROL: "Buut of course that was all hype. Did you know some people even committed suicide when the world didn't end at midnight on January 31st? Hysterical."
YOU: "doesn't sound all that funny"
CONTROL: "Maybe not, maybe not. Well let me use my own sources for this Vertigo Temple and we'll see if I can get some more substantial info."
CONTROL: "Oh and I want to break into that server, the one with the numbers."
CONTROL: "The pages are almost certainly autogenerated garbage but I have a feeling we'll find one of our masterminds has secrets on that machine."
YOU: "what websites? numbers?"
CONTROL: "Oh didn't you follow those URLs posted on Wolfe?"
CONTROL: "You may want to do that."

PARTNER: "hey sorry to bother you again, but you don't have like... eyes on your house?"
YOU: "my apartment doesn't have eyes. doesn't have a nose either, or a face or ears or anything"
PARTNER: "eyes on your house! enemy eyes! no one's watching your place?"
YOU: "no"
PARTNER: "weird, I could swear I've got company here where I'm at"
PARTNER: "they're crafty, sort of, moving out of sight when I look for them? but I know they're there"
PARTNER: "don't tell Control about this lol, she'd think I'm seeing things"
YOU: "can do"

YOU: "hi, sorry, I wasn't sure what was happening earlier, I had just woken up"
YOU: "I didn't post that message on the BBS. someone else did it and used my number, not sure why"
YOU: "but it sounds like you knew Elle? it looks like she might be alive after all, and I'm looking for her"
SKETCH: "Oh. We know each other? Don't we?"
SKETCH: "Wait."
SKETCH: "Control?"
YOU: "not sure what you mean, but, I don't think I know you. Elle was my sister. we were out of touch for about a year"
SKETCH: "Don't play around. Control. It's me. Lang."
YOU: "yeah I don't know you"
SKETCH: "More like. You wished you didn't know me. Been a while, hasn't it, Control?"
SKETCH: "Is Z still a thing? No? How sad."
YOU: "I'm working with Control but I'm not her"
SKETCH: "You are pretending to be your own minion but I know how you work. Control. Remember? You don't have to act."
SKETCH: "This conversation is over. Next time I speak it will be to Control. GoodBye."

YOU: "you know anyone called Lang?"
PARTNER: "uh I do actually, that's a blast from the past"
YOU: "they got in touch from the Wolfe post. who are they?"
PARTNER: "coworker, or, ex-coworker, they're a rotten egg, you can block them"
YOU: "they seemed to know Elle"
PARTNER: "whoever's using that name probably isn't the real Lang anyway, just block them"

YOU: "someone calling themselves Lang got in touch with me"
YOU: "they were talking about you?"
CONTROL: "Lang? No kidding. I wonder if that's actually them or just someone borrowing the name."
CONTROL: "Forward the number. I'll reach out."
YOU: "[1 contact attachment]"
CONTROL: "I hiighly doubt Goodwin will be thrilled but that's okay. I can talk to him too."

SKETCH: "Apologies. You are not Control."
YOU: "I did tell you that"
SKETCH: "If Elle has reSurfaced here, I'd also like to find her. If I can."
SKETCH: "I am just not sure if it's possible. Or if she's here."
YOU: "she texted me two nights ago, or at least someone with her number did"
SKETCH: "It was likely an imposter."
YOU: "you didn't get a video from her number?"
SKETCH: "I have had no contact with any member of Z for over a year."
SKETCH: "I would request you trust me. I can be helpful."
SKETCH: "If you want proof of that, please visit the VT site again. 98.137.246.7 ."

SKETCH: "She gave it to me. In case something happened. Long time ago."
YOU: "this is your information?"
SKETCH: "This is Orion's information. Their file. On Elle."
SKETCH: "I merely gave you the key."

PARTNER: "hey I've been talking to Lang, they're sketchy as hell"
PARTNER: "the real lang bailed on us last year just before Z unraveled, they ran and never looked back"
PARTNER: "getting in touch now, through you? no idea what they're playing at"

Y!SMS: "2001-03-11: Meteor shower visibility update: should be observable with naked eye tonight past 11:00"

CONTROL: "Alllright. I've come to a decision. We're dealing Lang in."
YOU: "as in they're joining the investigation?"
CONTROL: "They say they want to find Elle. You and Goodwin want to find Elle. I want to figure out this puzzle."
CONTROL: "So it'd only be logical to work with them, yes? 
YOU: "if they're trustworthy, I suppose"
CONTROL: "Trust is a funny thing. You don't need trustworthy people as long as you have trustworthy information."
CONTROL: "And Lang sent you that RECORD key, didn't they? With the numbers after it?"
YOU: "yeah. I checked it out. it looks like Orion was keeping tabs on her?"
CONTROL: "Sheesh, she either joined them or they were stalking her. Any idea what any of that information means? The Orion level or things like that?"
YOU: "none"
CONTROL: "I'm going after this server to try and ferret out more working keys like the one Lang had. This will be fun."
CONTROL: "While I'm doing that, I have Goodwin heading out to the church/temple that was in Elle's photos. Your job is to get Lang up to speed."

-- fade to black and back
SKETCH: "Thanks for the inforMation."
SKETCH: "I have one question."
YOU: "fire away, although I don't know if I'll have answers."
SKETCH: "When you found the crash. You are positive the driver was not in Elle's car?"
YOU: "there was no driver. it was abandoned"
SKETCH: "That isn't possible."
YOU: "maybe they wandered away and covered their footprints"
SKETCH: "That is possible. But I question your perception."
YOU: "I searched pretty thoroughly. I found Elle's stuff, just not her"
YOU: "you have a theory?"
SKETCH: "Yes. And no. I am almost sure now Elle joined Orion."
SKETCH: "You are aware your sister was a member of the hacking/cybercrime ring 'Z'?"
YOU: "kind of figured that out"
SKETCH: "We were all contracted on a certain job for a 'Vertigo Temple.' This was late '99. She could've become involved then. Possibly."
SKETCH: "These organizations are related. Orion is the hands. Vertigo the brain. Possibly."
SKETCH: "But the Vertigo founder killed himself in 2000. Vertigo Temple is extinct. Mass suicide."
YOU: "what was the job?"
SKETCH: "Can't tell. But it was botched. Elle died. I fled. Z unwound."
SKETCH: "If there is the slightest chance she did live. And that Elle still exists on this earth. Then I must do everything to find her."

PARTNER: "hey, I'm on the bus headed up to Mission, bored as hell"
PARTNER: "just wanted to say not to feed Lang too much"
YOU: "why not?"
PARTNER: "well for one thing, they're blowing up my phone right now telling me to be careful with the 27th/Mission church"
PARTNER: "to start, this cult's a bunch of toothless cowards"
PARTNER: "and, well, the Lang I knew did not give two shits about my safety, so, this is probably fake-Lang"

SKETCH: "I forgot to mention. Be wary."
SKETCH: "I know Goodwin is a fool. But. I suspect that after leaving Z, Orion Devout became his new employer."

YOU: "hey. you messaged me a few days ago. you're with Orion Devout, aren't you?"
CULT: "Hello!"
CULT: "You must be looking for answers. You've thought about the questions?"
YOU: "thought maybe you could tell me more about Orion"
CULT: "Maybe! But you've thought about the questions, and what they mean?"
CULT: "Do you believe in life after death?"
YOU: "no"
CULT: "Hmm. Well, through our Heavenly Father, you can live on, if it's in accordance with the Plan. Does that make sense?"
YOU: "do you know anything about Vertigo Temple?"
YOU: "...you there?"
CULT: "[Message send failed - You have been blocked by this SMS customer]"

CONTROL: "Breakthrouuugh! Braekthrough breakthrough breakthough!"
CONTROL: "I'm in the Vertigo Temple web server. It's also Orion Devout's web server. They're for sure the same organization."
YOU: "awesome! nice work"
CONTROL: "Maybe they just changed their name from Vertigo to Orion post-2000. Who knows?"
YOU: "any good finds?"
CONTROL: "It's just a web server. The real mainframe is somewhere else. That's the thing with the DB, that controls all the RECORD files."
CONTROL: "I did find the real floorplans for the warehouse you visited last night though. And figured out why it looked so bare."
CONTROL: "It's underground. Underground! There's a hidden doorway."
YOU: "damn, so I missed it"
CONTROL: "It's well-hidden. Get your ass back to that warehouse and I'll guide you through, proper this time!"
CONTROL: "I'm dying to get my hands on that mainframe. With luck that's where it's hidden!"

-- to the warehouse again

CONTROL: "Drop me a line once you're inside."

SKETCH: "I heard you're going to the compound. Be wary."

Y!SMS: "2001-03-11: Police issue missing persons alert for six men and women from the Metro Park area"

YOU: "I'm inside. the same door was open"
CONTROL: "Excellent. Keep moving down the main hall while I pull up the map."
-- power out
YOU: "the lights are out. was that your doing?"
CONTROL: "Daaamn it. It's a power outage. No electricity at my place and my internet connection is dead. I can't get anything."
CONTROL: "Sit tight."

Y!SMS: "2001-03-11: Mass blackout reported to affect 80% of city power customers"

PARTNER: "you there? I can't get in touch with Control"
YOU: "I was texting her a minute ago. sounds like the power's out"
PARTNER: "of course it's out, fucking hell, it's out here too"
PARTNER: "this temple thing's a maze, I swear they're patrolling it"
PARTNER: "I need the lights back on NOW or this is going to go south pretty fucking quickly"
YOU: "you're still at 27th and Mission?"
PARTNER: "yeah, I think I'm trapped, the damn way I came in is locked"
PARTNER: "hang on, I have Control coming in"

CONTROL: "Listen, change of plan. How fast can you get to the north side?"
YOU: "that's the opposite end of town, and it's going to take time to find my way out of here without power"
CONTROL: "Dammit. I think Lang's in the city. I need to scramble someone to bail out Goodwin."

PARTNER: "I'm screwed, entirely screwed, well and truly fucked"
YOU: "what's happening down there?"
PARTNER: "I'm hiding, don't know how in the everloving christ these people knew I'd be here, or that the electricity would drop"
PARTNER: "don't think I'm going to make it out, but I think this was part of a PLAN, this setup"
PARTNER: "this has to have been a trap, I'm starting to understand it, not sure whether it was meant for you or me, but this was planned"
YOU: "hang in there, Control's got Lang coming for you"
PARTNER: "Lang? jesus shit no, this isn't going to work, this isn't going to work"
YOU: "should I tell her to call back Lang?"
YOU: "Goodwin? you alright?"

SIS: "***Hello"
YOU: "Elle, is that you?"
SIS: "Of course it is, silly"
YOU: "I don't believe it"
SIS: "My birthday's February 8th, my favorite food is a a French omelette, as kids our hideout was the concrete tunnel in the old creek"
SIS: "Is that enough for you?"
YOU: "sorry, it's just, hard to swallow that you're really alive"
YOU: "you faked your own death? were you on the run from these Orion Devout people?"
SIS: "No, of course not"
SIS: "You have it backwards, as it's only thanks to them that I'm alive"
YOU: "where are you?"
SIS: "You can't find me"
SIS: "I'm somewhere else, in a deeper communion with our Heavenly Father"
YOU: "you're not Elle, then. you're one of them"
SIS: "No, it's me, your sister Danielle"
SIS: "I'm talking to you now because you're making good progress and you need to learn your part in the Plan"
YOU: "I don't know what plan you're talking about. you sound like you joined a cult."
SIS: "No one understands the Plan while they're still in their shell, so there's no need to be worried or afraid"
SIS: "Think of it as being a gear in a Grand Machine - the gear need not know its purpose to carry out its job"
SIS: "What you need to consider is mortality, and immortality, and life after death, and whether or not you want to live forever"
SIS: "When you understand the Plan, that's when we'll meet again"
SIS: "Love, Elle ***"

SKETCH: "Do you know Goodwin's location?"
YOU: "the Mission st place? or within it?"
SKETCH: "Within the temple. Do you know his location?"
SKETCH: "He won't respond to my messages. I'm on Control's orders."
YOU: "I don't know where he is. he said he was hiding"
SKETCH: "I am uneasy about this. I truly believe Goodwin is the cult's plant."
YOU: "really?"
SKETCH: "I'm going in. Regardless. I have to take this risk."

YOU: "Goodwin? Lang's on their way, where are you inside the temple?"
PARTNER: "i am dead, i am entirely fucking dead"
YOU: "what's going on in there? what can we do to help?"
PARTNER: "nothing, i'm doomed, it's over"
PARTNER: "listen i don't care what you hear from me from now on, once they get my phone i know they'll joke around and make you think i'm alive but it's over"
PARTNER: "don't be fooled"
PARTNER: "and elle is GONE man, i'm sorry, i think i get it now"
YOU: "hold out, Lang is almost there. where are you?"

-- lights back on
CONTROL: "Okay! Sorry about that. Power's back here at Control's place."
YOU: "Goodwin's in trouble"
CONTROL: "Yeah, he's going to be in trouble with me, having to scramble Lang and leave you hanging like that."
CONTROL: "Lang got there in time; he should be safe now. It was looking grim for a while, but, mission success."
CONTROL: "How are things there?"
YOU: "lights are back, and I found the entrance on my own... place is a maze though"
CONTROL: "Head home for tonight."
CONTROL: "Goodwin managed to get his hands on a machine connected directly to the Vertigo Temple mainframe."
CONTROL: "If I play my cards right, we might not need you to get physical access."
YOU: "got it, I'll pull out"
CONTROL: "I'm so close I can feel it. The answer will be mine!"
