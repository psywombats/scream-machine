PARTNER: "hey? anyone home? this the right number?"
YOU: "if you're another jehovah's witness, go away, I already blocked one this morning"
PARTNER: "if you block me, you WILL regretit, I might even go to the cops"
PARTNER: "you WERE there this morning, weren't you?"
YOU: "the wreck?"
PARTNER: "KNEW it"
YOU: "who is this?"
PARTNER: "name is Goodwin"
PARTNER: "well not really but it's fine to call me that"
PARTNER: "first thing you need to tell me is who you are, what you were doing this morning, and"
PARTNER: "and where you got that car, to start"
YOU: "that's three things, and I don't know who you think I am"
PARTNER: "you crashed this morning, 64th st, there were footprints leading away from the wreck"
PARTNER: "your footprints also lead to the wreck, and I KNOW it isn't your car, so..."
YOU: "you followed footprints?"
PARTNER: "nah, but I was tipped off that it was the person at this number who was on the scene"
PARTNER: "so what is the setup? what's the plan? what did you do with Elle?"
YOU: "Elle? you know her?"
PARTNER: "Elle Applewhite, vanished about a year ago"
PARTNER: "did you kill her or something without knowing her name?"
YOU: "Applewhite wasn't her real name, she was my sister"
YOU: "and she didn't disappear a year ago, she died... I was at the funeral"
PARTNER: "her brother, then? I was at the funeral too but, guess she's still out there, huh?"
YOU: "she messaged me. or someone with her number did"
PARTNER: "what about?"
YOU: "a star. and a video, you could call it."
PARTNER: "huh. I got the message about the new star too, and that DAMN video"
PARTNER: "I have no other real reason to trust you, but I guess I'm a trusting guy eh?"
PARTNER: "I've been looking for Elle about month now, figured why not, I'm out of work anyway"
PARTNER: "she was being tailed when she supposedly died, I know that much, damn suspicious if you ask me"
PARTNER: "and couple weeks, back there were traces of her at old worksites, stuff that really no one but her could've known"
YOU: "so you're one of her 'work' partners"
PARTNER: "just a footman in the scheme of things but yeah, we were associates, business partners you could say"
YOU: "oh."
PARTNER: "not a huge fan?"
YOU: "I didn't talk to her for almost two years before her death"
YOU: "she fell into some shady career, I thought. she never really said"
PARTNER: "lol, well, judge all you want, I'M the one searching for her already you know"
YOU: "sorry, I just mean... I don't have the details of what she was up to before her death"
PARTNER: "luckily I do! not that I feel like telling you, if you're going to be all judgy, and I'm not sure you aren't actually the psycho or religious nut that was stalking her"
PARTNER: "you're not right?"
YOU: "I'm not a psycho or religious nut, no, not that I know of"
PARTNER: "excellent, SANE people I can work with. maybe we can share info"
YOU: "I have no info except the messages I received this morning, which it sounds like you got as well"
PARTNER: "did you spot anything in the wreck? I saw the prints, you cased that car pretty good"
YOU: "oh, there was a camera, I think the photos were recent but I have no idea where they're from"
YOU: "[7 image attachments]"
YOU: "and a phone, I think it must've been hers. the contacts were wiped except for an ORION."
PARTNER: "THOSE people?"
YOU: "er, just one person. does 'orion' mean something to you? I suppose it's a star"
PARTNER: "it's a constellation, also an organization, sorta"
PARTNER: "the only guy I could find who had spotted Elle this past year when she should've been dead, he was a member of this thing called Orion Devout"
PARTNER: "they're like... I don't know, one of those new social things for lonely people with limited SMS budgets, seemed to involve lots of txts from strangers"
PARTNER: "I cleared them from the investigation first thing, it's just a bunch of kids"
YOU: "maybe that was it. this ORION contact sent a bunch of nonsense, I figured it might be a code or something"
PARTNER: "hmmm sounds fishy, doesn't sound like my Orion Devout guys after all actually"
PARTNER: "listen, though, I'll put you in touch with a friend of mine who might find that message realllly interesting, she's into codes and that sort of funny stuff"
YOU: "another business partner?"
PARTNER: "yeah, but she was a friend of Elle too, worked with her about as much as I did, way smarter than me too haha"
YOU: "well... thanks."
PARTNER: "[1 contact attachment]"
PARTNER: "no problem bud, consider it thanks for these photos. maybe I'll even drop you a line if I figure anything out haha"

YOU: "hello, you don't know me but I'm a relative of someone you knew as Elle Applewhite"
YOU: "I've learned she might still be alive and someone called Goodwin told me you might be able to help"
CONTROL: "Ahhh, yes, Elle, the dead-yet-not-dead missing woman. Funny, how's someone supposed to be both dead and missing?"
YOU: "I was told you might have information"
CONTROL: "Hmmm maybe it's not as funny if you're her parent, I suppose. Sorry. I haven't spoken to her since her not-death."
YOU: "I'm her brother, actually. Goodwin said you were interested in codes, or that sort of thing?"
CONTROL: "Pfff. It's that guy's idea of a joke. You're speaking with Control."
YOU: "control?
CONTROL: "Yes, the very same. Control. The brains behind most of Z's jobs, back when Z was still a thing."
YOU: "I don't know z either"
CONTROL: "Serious? Elle's brother and she never told you what she did for a living?"
YOU: "we were estranged"
CONTROL: "But yeah if Goodwin sent you my way then he must figure something needs hacking? What you got for me?"
YOU: "he never mentioned anything like that, just something that might be a code"
YOU: "I have Elle's phone, I think. there's a message from an 'ORION' that's suspicious, but that's all I have to go off, that and a prank video from this morning"
CONTROL: "Oh. So you got that too huh?"
CONTROL: "What did you think?"
YOU: "unsettling"
CONTROL: "It's intriguing, is what it is. Some person had to have made that. Why? What's the motive, right?"
CONTROL: "And to start figured it was just the old Z crew that got sent it. So I supposed it was an ex-client trying to intimidate us. But if her brother got it too..."
CONTROL: "I'm actually interested now. Not often I've gotten puzzles like this. So then Elle's brother, send me what you got."
YOU: "[1 text attachment]"
YOU: "that's all of it. it ran across a couple messages"
CONTROL: "I'll run some analysis and get back to you."
CONTROL: "And I suppose I'd better get in touch with Goodwin. He's been trying to rope me into his hunt for Elle since February."
CONTROL: "Hadn't heard from the man since Z went down and now he's trying to call in favors... Shameless as always."
CONTROL: "Do a favor for me though and see if you can any info on who sent this message. Might help me crack the thing."
YOU: "I'm not really sure where to start, but I can try"

Y!SMS: "2001-03-10: Police seek assailant for an apparently random assault on 3rd street, no known motive"

PARTNER: "hey, just thought I'd mention these photos are NEW, taken last week"
PARTNER: "unless you altered them somehow?"
YOU: "I didn't touch them"
YOU: "what makes you think they're recent?"
PARTNER: "you know that substation fire back on the 3rd, knocked out power south of the highway?"
YOU: "yeah?"
PARTNER: "you can see the damaged powerlines in these"
YOU: "then you know where they were taken?"
PARTNER: "still working on it, could be anywhere south of 25th, but like, the moon is in the wrong direction"
PARTNER: "I'm actually out for a stroll right now haha, I know the city pretty well so I'm sure I'll jog my memory eventually"
YOU: "good luck"

Good news! The kingdom of the heavens is at hand!
Exactly two thousand years ago, our Heavenly Father manifested to us in a physical body (shell) to guide us upon this transient earth. Our predecessor students looked to their teacher to give them answers to the Plan and answers to the Great Questions that humans propose.
One thousand years later, this cycle repeated as followers of our Heavenly Father faced down the Saracens, Vikings, Magyars but stood firm to His Plan, in the understanding that soon they would reach the next evolutionary level, above our present understanding of this Shell (fake) world.
Now at the zenith of the millenium, the time has come again to gather under His banner and bring the cosmic Heaven to earth, so that the plan may come to fruition. We urge students young and old to discard their shells and follow in these footsteps two millenia in the making.

PARTNER: "aha, I got it figured out"
YOU: "the video?"
PARTNER: "no that thing's a JOKE, no one's ever gonna figure that one out"
PARTNER: "I mean the photos. I didn't regonize where they were taken cause it's two spots"
PARTNER: "you ever been to 27th and Mission?"
YOU: "no, that's the complete opposite end of the city from here"
PARTNER: "there's some sort of building there. I'd call it a church but those things usually have crosses out front. temple maybe?"
PARTNER: "bottom line, that's one of the spots our Elle was photographing"
PARTNER: "second is a bad neighborhood north of 63rd, somewhere around washington station?"
PARTNER: "not sure on the exact location, but I had a job out there way back, was a client holed in a warehouse back there and I was the rendezvous guy"
PARTNER: "don't think Elle was on that job though? just me and Control"
PARTNER: "oh yeah, you get in touch with her?"
YOU: "yes, she's looking at the message from Orion"
YOU: "why did you say Orion Devout was a club or something? looks more like a religion to me"
PARTNER: "eh? well, let's say I'm covering the Elle thing from a couple angles, the video from this morning isn't even my top lead, I don't care about Orion"
PARTNER: "but I KNOW if I can get my hands on the goon(s) that were trailing her around when she vanished the first time, I can find the mastermind behind this"
PARTNER: "that's just what I'm good at y'know"
YOU: "well... if you say"
YOU: "their webpage didn't look like anything special"
PARTNER: "and what did you say to Control? I've been trying to get her to help on this thing forever but she always kept laughing me off"
PARTNER: "actually hey wait, getting messages from her now. chat later, ciao"

CONTROL: "I have good news and I have boring news. Are you around?"
YOU: "here, sorry"
CONTROL: "No worries. The boring news is that the Orion message a cipher, a poor one. I didn't have to do any thinking, just sent it through my usual tools."
CONTROL: "Took a bit to recognize though because what came out on the other side is almost as nonsense as the input."
CONTROL: "http://cool.13.monoceros.net/theroux/1DC85139/947D/1121/7194/6BF43E3B603A.cg?5A=DF666B5779FA"
YOU: "a url?"
CONTROL: "Maybe. I was using some random keys to try to intrepret the message but seeing as there are some English words in there, I suppose that must be the solution."
CONTROL "But if the check the site for yourself, it's hard to believe anyone would need to link this to your sister."

CONTROL: "Did you check it?"
CONTROL: "It's a dead end, I would think."
YOU: "I saw it"
YOU: "This is the Orion Devout homepage"
CONTROL: "Hmmm. I'm not familiar."
YOU: "they're a new age religion, or a club or something if you ask Goodwin"
YOU: "your friend Goodwin ran into them earlier, running after Elle. he thought 'orion' might refer to them"
CONTROL: "Welll new age cults might be one thing, but I thought they'd died out since Y2K turned out to be a flop? And don't they have better websites than this? Shameful."
YOU: "no, it's their site, but, it's not - their public one is cleaner"
CONTROL: "Buut, if it's as you say, and if Goodwin's report is right, they must be involved."
YOU: "Goodwin's report?"
CONTROL: "Aha. Yes. Goodwin is my man on the ground. I don't really leave my house, so, he used to find the jobs, meet the clients, and so forth."
CONTROL: "Of course he fills me in on what he finds."
CONTROL: "The temple or church he found up north, I don't know what that is. But the warehouse, that's registered to an O.Devout down at the city office."
YOU: "he seemed pretty convinced orion devout had nothing to do with it"
CONTROL: "He's wrong. Let him do the footwork, I'll do the thinking. Speaking of which - give me a minute."

PARTNER: "hey hey my man, are you in on this?"
YOU: "in on what?"
PARTNER: "oh, I guess Control got to me first, she likes me best"
PARTNER: "but I have marching orders, just the like the old Z days. except we have you, instead of Elle"
YOU: "what are you up to? you heard that warehouse you found is registered to Orion Devout?"
PARTNER: "yeah yeah, I'm big enough to admit when I was wrong, those new-age hippies are in on it, so I'll follow Control's plan"
PARTNER: "I'm headed for the city archives to check on that registration tonight, and if that falls through, the temple thing up north"
PARTNER: "maybe if the warehouse doesn't pan out, we'll meet in person?"
PARTNER: "until then, seeya"

CONTROL: "I have a proposal."
YOU: "I was talking to Goodwin, sorry. here now"
CONTROL: "Thaaaat fool. Always takes the drama out of everything."
YOU: "the proposal?"
CONTROL: "Of course."
CONTROL: "Elle was a partner of mine. Not a friend, but a very, very good partner. I know I owe her brother some closure."
CONTROL: "It's clear to me there's a puzzle before us, from our old days as Z, or maybe deeper than that. We'll learn soon enough."
CONTROL: "But whoever is behind this Orion's Devout - I want to figure out their plan. This video, this message someone sent as Elle..."
CONTROL: "I don't want to get your hopes up. We both know she's dead. But some shadow has decided to adopt her name."
YOU: "I don't follow"
CONTROL: "It's a game, you see. I know I'm up for unraveling its purpose. If you are too, then follow my instructions, and we'll figure it out."
YOU: "and I don't care about games"
YOU: "...but if Elle is wrapped up in it, I don't have a choice"
CONTROL: "Hmmm, not the endorsement I would've liked, but that's enough for me."
CONTROL: "I'm going to break the passwords on these websites belonging to Orion. This should be child's play to me but in the meantime..."
CONTROL: "Goodwin is my right hand. He's conducting interviews tonight, research and surveillance. If he's my right, will you be my left?"
CONTROL: "I need you at the warehouse near Washington St. I doubt it will be open, in which case we'll move to the temple on 64th. Can you do that for me?"
YOU: "I'll do what I can"
CONTROL: "Perfect. Perrrfect. Let's see just what sort of plot Elle got herself pulled into."

PARTNER: "the name 'Marcel Theroux' do anything for you?"
YOU: "nope"
PARTNER: "damn, I'm at city hall, and he's the actual person behind all these leases"
YOU: "do have his address?"
PARTNER: "nah, he's long dead. suicide in february 2000, that's over a year ago"

CONTROL: "Oh left hand, are you there?"
YOU: "the warehouse is open"
CONTROL: "Hahaa. It's possible this is a trap."
YOU: "should I back out?"
CONTROL: "That would be quite the letdown. No, I have some info that might help you out here."
CONTROL: "That 'warehouse' is actually a compound of sorts, a main office for the Orion Devout administration."
YOU: "how do you figure that?"
CONTROL: "Their public server was exposed via at least three backdoors it was so out of date. I didn't even need to crack the password."
CONTROL: "On my screen now I have a photo tour of this compound."
YOU: "I've just found the back entrance, not on Washington, it's on King's St. or something
CONTROL: "That should be the main hall."
YOU: "There's only junk here."
CONTROL: "Stop off to your right first. You'll like what you see."

YOU: "it's a pile of rubbish. this a joke?"
CONTROL: "Rubbish? Pffff. It's their archives. Don't you appreciate paper?"
YOU: "there's nothing here but trash. this place has been empty a while."
CONTROL: "I could've sworn this data was recent. Last month at the latest."
CONTROL: "Neeever mind. Keep exploring. If you find anything that looks like a server, talk to me right away."
YOU: "no luck so far"

Y!SMS: "2001-03-10: Fire reported on 22nd St, seek alternate routes to avoid traffic congestion"

PARTNER: "hey you got any questions you want to ask an Orion Devout guy?"
YOU: "what? well I want to know what really happened to my sister obviously"
PARTNER: "I mean I could ask this dude that, but I doubt he'd know, seems more scared than anything"
YOU: "you found a member?"
PARTNER: "sure did, he's been maintaining the titles since that Theroux guy croaked"
PARTNER: "Control didn't have anything she wanted me to put to him though, so I figured I'd ask you"
YOU: "he doesn't know anything about a plan? or a father? or who Orion is?"
PARTNER: "one sec"

CONTROL: "Heeey, my trusted left hand, there's a small room at the end of the hall, almost straight across from the back door. Have you seen it?"
YOU: "just got there"
CONTROL: "Aha! The mainframe is there. What's the model?"
YOU: "nothing here but a few empty boxes, and more trash"
CONTROL: "Damn."
YOU: "your info is old"
CONTROL: "Looook, by what these people had up on their site, that warehouse you'rr in was their veritable headquarters."
CONTROL: "Should I send you a photo of their founder having a conference there? How about a state senator? This used to be a really ritzy place."
YOU: "what caused them to abandon it?"
CONTROL: "I have no idea. It all happened in maaaaybe the last 18 months."
YOU: "so it could've been in 1999"
CONTROL: "So?"
YOU: "nothing. but it'd be before Elle died"
CONTROL: "You think this is a Y2K thing? Don't be a fool."
YOU: "that isn't what I said at all"
CONTROL: "Fair. And if you aren't lying to me, then the whole place has been abandoned since then..."
CONTROL: "And you aren't lying, are you?"
YOU: "what reason would I have for that?"
CONTROL: "Wellll, we've never met. And they say: beware who you meet online. Haha."
CONTROL: "Let me check with Goodwin. See if you can salvage anything out of tonight's job though."

PARTNER: "yeah so Orion guy was a bust"
YOU: "the member you were interviewing?"
PARTNER: "he escaped"
YOU: "wait what exactly did you do to him?"
PARTNER: "it wasn't anything illegal, I swear"
PARTNER: "besides he didn't know anything, like I told you this Orion club is just a thing for lonely people"
PARTNER: "he got some sms messages about people he was supposed to talk to, a job or two he had to do, then he chickened out of the job, and that was it"
YOU: "what job?"
PARTNER: "was supposed to be a lookout for something going down at George and 16th, vandalism I guess? dunno"
PARTNER: "bottom line, none of these people have any idea what they're doing"
PARTNER: "on the other hand, I think I have a lead on the people that were shadowing your sis"
YOU: "yeah?"
PARTNER: "well I probably shouldn't go into it"
PARTNER: "I told Control, so if she thinks you need to know, you'll know"

YOU: "this place is empty"
CONTROL: "No machines? No mainframe?" 
YOU: "the most I found was a tape"
CONTROL: "VHS? Casette? Or code for some ancient computer?"
YOU: "vhs it looks like"
CONTROL: "Aand what's on it, then?"
YOU: "no way to tell"
CONTROL: "Fine. We'll call tonight a failure."
CONTROL: "It's early, but you can go home."
YOU: "the sun is almost up"
CONTROL: "Irrrelevant. Just get home, cut me a copy of your tape just in case, and we'll regroup later"

THEROUX: "Greetings my students, and welcome to Ad Astra. I'm speaking to you today as a representative of the Holy Father, and while I still might be a mere shell myself, I hope I can answer your questions and help guide to a better understanding of His plan."
THEROUX: "I assume you already know that I stand before you in fulfilment the two thousand years of prophecy that have come before. I'm not up to the task. But as the current representive of His astral will on earth, I will try to convey to you a summary of the next level of consciousness."
THEROUX: "The Ad Astra series is intended only for students above the Lepus level, the septenarians. I'm afraid if you've yet to reach this level of understanding of the Plan, what I say tonight may only serve to confuse you."
THEROUX: "In tonight's lecture, what I want to emphasize to you, above all else, is the concept of transcendence. We call it ascendance? In the east, the boddhisvatas call it Enlightenment."
THEROUX: "I myself have achieved this level of understanding. And by some intrigue in His plan, some cosmic fluke, I have been sent back to this shell of mine, to this fake Earth. I believe that this was for your sake, my students."
THEROUX: "Having glimpsed that purest reality, that classroom set in the heavens where the forge of creation once dwelt... I only hope to convey to you a glimpse of that transcendant reality."
THEROUX: "How many of us here today have not experienced doubts, setbacks, obstacles in the course of carrying out His plan?"
THEROUX: "All of us?"
THEROUX: "And how many can say that we truly understand His plan for this plane?"
THEROUX: "None of us?"
THEROUX: "That, of course, that is the crux of my lecture."
THEROUX: "Yesterday, as I witnessed the first solar eclipse of His new millenium, I thought, and I realized..."
THEROUX: "Disease-by-mail, power-failure, solar-storm, eternity-war, the thousand-harbingers-of-a-neomillenial-age..."
THEROUX: "His Plan had become inscrutable and far less clear."
THEROUX: "That we occupy these mortal shells is a sign of our incomplete understanding. As His vessel did two thousand years ago and as I do now, we must see these shells as what they are: shackles on our sapience, mere speedbumps in the road that is the extraterrestrial exit from this earth."
THEROUX: "A student once asked me: Why do bad things happen to good people?"
THEROUX: "And I answereed: I cannot know, only He can know, for it is part of His plan."
THEROUX: "A student once asked me: Why must we suffer in these shells, when the kingdom of the heavens is at hand?"
THEROUX: "And I answered: We cannot know, only He can know, for we are only cogs in the Grand Machine, the Truth, the Gestalt, the Split Second Instant Of Truth."
THEROUX: "Follow the Plan. Find the answers to this riddle of stars, soul, sentience, the satanic doubt that lurks at the heart of every man and his impure shell."
THEROUX: "Believe in life after death. That your memories, consciousness, will live on. As above, so below. May his Plan be carried out on earth as it is in the heavens."

CONTROL: "Hiiya. That tape. You cut all you could get?"
YOU: "yeah. watched it too"
CONTROL: "Nooo kiiding. Some fun stuff, don't you think?"
YOU: "I talked to Goodwin. Theroux killed himself in 2000"
CONTROL: "Hmm doesn't matter too much to us, does it? If they were still after Elle after that?"
YOU: "they were? did you hear that from Goodwin? he's been getting cagey on me"
CONTROL: "You can ask anyone on the BBS's. Theroux was pretty well-known around there.
YOU: "not sure what BBS is"
CONTROL "Shiit man, a bulletin board system? You've never been on one?"
CONTROL: "I'll give you an address. You can dial in if you're prepared. You can keep a secret?"
YOU: "I'll try"
CONTROL: "Haha, you'd better do more than that. This is an intelligence BBS. Invite only. Consider me your invite."
CONTROL: "I figured I'd go fishing under one of my puppet accounts and see if Orion would get any bites. Itttt's minnows, almost entirely, I'm afraid."
CONTROL: "But that wouldn't deter you would it? My dear left hand?"
YOU: "[1 unknown attachment]"
CONTROL: "Danke."
YOU: "?"
CONTROL: "Thank you. German. Work on your culture."
YOU: "you got the video?"
CONTROL: "This looks moooderately wortheless, not going to lie. But I'll see if I can wrap my brain around it."
CONTROL: "You did good tonight though. Better than Goodwin, that ass. He let some Orion adherent escape and has nothing to show for it."
CONTROL: "And don't go poking your head too deep on this BBS, okay? It's referral only. If you show your fool head I might be in trouble."
YOU: "stop worrying, I won't do anything stupid"

SYSOP: "Welcome to HAXXOR-WOLFE-BBS. Your source for the truly L33T out there, masked heroes in our midst!"
SYSOP: "Enter auth token here. Or be automatically disconnected in 60 second(s)."
OP: "Orion Devout. I maaaay have got a couple sms from these guys the past couple days. Anyone know what they're about?"
ANON: "Dude. If you got recruited by those asshats you must have zero standards... lock your door next time"
ANON: "Oh, my friend got in with them once. It's sort of like... a chat society for strangers? You get a txt every once in a while from someone who knows what to do"
ANON: "Cult. Lamer cult too. They worship the wires. Idiots. Clearly."
ANON: "*THIS IS THE FIRST LEVEL. YOU CAN ASCEND TO THE NEXT IF YOU SO CHOOSE. THE PLAN IS CLEAR*"
ANON: "you know just because you put stars around your message doesn't make it important?"
ANON: "looool wwwwwww you actually fell for that? you're gonna ascend to the absolute retard plane of existence hahahahahaha"
ANON: "Orion is internet-savvy. They have eyes here no doubt. Ignore people like this ^. would bet anything they have seen it."
ANON: "Wwhy would you post this here?"
ANON: "Is this about The Plan? I think that's a conspiracy theory. I don't really get it. But for sure there's a Plan."
ANON: "Look dude I'm gonna lose rep for saying this but stay out of Orion. We're in digi-space here. Digi-hell? Whatever. Point is it's not the real world."
ANON: "...continued. Orion exists across these real/not-real boundaries. So, be careful. Stay human. And, most importantly, don't fuck with Vertigo Temple."


CONTROL: "You got in okay? Yeah?"
YOU: "yeah. but it's late here. I need to sleep"
CONTROL: "No skin off my back. Get a good night (morning's?) rest and we'll see where we're at."
