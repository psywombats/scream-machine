PARTNER: "been getting a lot junk sms this morning... it's got to be Orion"
YOU: "what exactly happened last night?"
PARTNER: "don't really want to talk about it"
PARTNER: "on the plus side, I trust Lang now though"
PARTNER: "I would've been toast if they hadn't shown up"
PARTNER: "hey you got eyes on your place?"
YOU: "I don't think so"
YOU: "I definitely saw them last night, though, shadows tailing me"
PARTNER: "see, I WASN'T so crazy after all"
PARTNER: "they're swarming me now though, swear it's more cultists outside than real people"
YOU: "what do mean 'real' people?"
PARTNER: "oh, lol, don't know why I said that, they just sort of seem like, not people like you and me, that you can reach out and touch"
PARTNER: "not that I can really reach out and touch you, if you're just a phone"
YOU: "I... don't think I'm just a phone. I'm the person on the other end"
PARTNER: "lol sorry, it's too early for philosophy"
PARTNER: "anyway, I'm kind of beat, not really sure I'm going to be able to keep up with the investigation, if this is how things keep turning out"

SKETCH: "Hello."
YOU: "oh, hi"
YOU: "sounds like you saved the day last night"
SKETCH: "I would not have had to do anything if had not been a trap in the first place."
SKETCH: "Did you find you way into the compoud?"
YOU: "didn't find much, but yeah"
SKETCH: "You are lucky to be alive."
SKETCH: "From what Goodwin and I found. That area is under surveillance."
SKETCH: "Without the power outAge I do not think you would be able to come and go so easily."
SKETCH: "This was orchestrated."
YOU: "you think Goodwin set the whole thing up?"
SKETCH: "Unsure."
SKETCH: "I need you to answer some questions. For me."
SKETCH: "Have you ever met Goodwin in person?"
YOU: "I have not, no"
SKETCH: "Have you ever a member of Orion Devout in person?"
YOU: "don't think so, actually, unless you count the people tailing me"
SKETCH: "Those are not people."
SKETCH: "And. You swear you did not find Elle's body at the site of the crash?"
YOU: "there was nobody there, I told you before. that'd make no sense"
SKETCH: "I see."
SKETCH: "When is the last time you met another human being? In person? Anyone?"
YOU: "...it's actually tough to tell"
SKETCH: "I have changed my mind."
SKETCH: "Goodwin is not the the cult plant. You are."
SKETCH: "Goodbye."
YOU: "what're you talking about? you think I'm working with Orion Devout?"
SKETCH: "[Message send failed - You have been blocked by this SMS customer]"

YOU: "hi, any updates?"
CONTROL: "My dear left hand! I might have to promote you to right hand; Goodwin seems pretty shaken up about yesterday."
CONTROL: "But yesss, updates, updates! I have a direct line to the Vertigo Temple system, thanks to the heroics last night."
CONTROL: "So far security is good, but I'll be in soon enough. Just to try to keep me out, culty weirdos."
YOU: "I'm not sure what that means"
CONTROL: "I'm not sure what I expect to find either, but at minimum, this is where that Wolfe BBS post came from, that framed you. Same IP."
YOU: "so it was someone with Vertigo Temple pretending to be me, asking for info about Vertigo Temple?"
CONTROL: "Possibly? Or someone who routed traffic through this mainframe used by VT."
CONTROL: "It looks like it's a pretty powerful machine so I don't know what it's doing crawling the net in the first place."
CONTROL: "I feel like I'm just one clue away from the whole puzzle fitting together."
CONTROL: "If you've got a chance, check Wolfe again. That post with your number keeps paying dividends."
CONTROL: "At this point I wouldn't even be bad at you if you did make it yourself!"

ANON: "Vertigo Temple. A religious organization founded by Marcel Theroux circa 1992. Around 1997 all of its adherents gave up their houses, jobs, possessions and families, and turned to lives of homeless itinerant preaching, city to city."
ANON: "They preached a milleniary vision where after two thousand years, the Heavenly Father would return to Earth and his children would become one with Him and attain enlightenment."
ANON: "With the coming and going of the year 2000, Marcel Theroux and what remained of his followers recorded farewell messages to their loved ones and proceeded to kill themselves via ritual self-immolation."

YOU: "is it true you guys did a job for Vertigo Temple back in '99? with Elle involved"
CONTROL: "Haha, who told you that?"
YOU: "Lang did, yesterday"
CONTROL: "I wasn't involved in that nonsense."

YOU: "hey, did you guys do a job for Vertigo Temple with Elle a year or two back?"
PARTNER: "did Lang tell you that?"
YOU: "yeah"
PARTNER: "then make Lang explain it, that was a nightmare"
YOU: "Lang blocked me"
PARTNER: "the fuck?"
PARTNER: "well, whatever, it's ancient history now, considering everyone in VT is dead"
PARTNER: "so, in Z, we operated in cells, all sort of working independently"
PARTNER: "Lang was the face of most operations, the one who sweet-talked clients, dealt with the sales and business end"
PARTNER: "when there was dirty work to do, I'd take over, like no need to hack if you can break into the machine room directly haha"
PARTNER: "Control did the delicate stuff, or Elle sometimes, and Elle would've been working this VT job if we had taken it"
PARTNER: "VT had like... identities, of all these people, and they were looking at moving money around using the ids"
PARTNER: "identity theft is easy, you just have to make sure whoever you're impersonating doesn't find out or died already"
PARTNER: "but this was weirder, really fucking weird, all these ids VT wanted to use were unsolved missing persons cases"
YOU: "what does that mean?"
PARTNER: "lol, well, if you go missing and your credit card info winds up in the hands of a y2k cult..."
PARTNER: "they either joined up with VT and were reported missing, or they got themselves killed by VT and their id stolen"
PARTNER: "either way this was some deep shit and we canceled the contract, then the vertigo temple rep got pissed"
PARTNER: "got threatening email from them forever, right up until they all lit themselves on fire"
PARTNER: "that should've ended things, but then, you know, a month later they killed Elle"
PARTNER: "we got mail, it was all 'Applewhite has joined us, we'll get to you next'"
PARTNER: "I mean maybe it wasn't actually vertigo temple people because this was after they were dead, but"
PARTNER: "how did they even know who Elle was? they had only ever dealt with Lang, Lang was the face of the deal"
PARTNER: "so Lang got spooked as shit, ran for it lol, the coward"
PARTNER: "actually everyone was pretty shaken up"
PARTNER: "and so that was the end of Z, no one wanted to work for Control any more"
YOU: "why didn't you tell me all this sooner?"
PARTNER: "it isn't relevant, is it?"
PARTNER: "I told you I was investigating the people that were trailing Elle back then, that's been my lead this whole time"
PARTNER: "and I mean... you were right about the business being rotten, guess maybe you were right"
PARTNER: "whoever killed her, it couldn't have been vertigo, they were all dead by feb 2000 anyway, right?"
PARTNER: "I've got a headache, talk later"
YOU: "thanks for coming clean, I guess"

Y!SMS: "2001-03-12: Telecommunications interruption reported south of 40th St, cause so far unknown"

CONTROL: "Heeey there. I rewatched that video you found with Marcel Theroux."
YOU: "anything interesting in that?"
CONTROL: "Did you notice he talks about watching the 'first solar eclipse of the new millenium?':
CONTROL: "And did you know that the first eclipse of the millenium wasn't until June 2000?"
YOU: "didn't know either of those things"
YOU: "maybe he
CONTROL: "But, the implication is clear, yes? Theroux was still alive in June 2000, and he was supposed to have killed himself in February of that year."
YOU: "could be a hoax, like he didn't actually see it"
CONTROL: "Noo, I think I have it figured out now. Vertigo Temple was only ever a cover for an identity theft ring."
CONTROL: "All these suicides related to VT... What if it was murder? Cover for someone to steal their IDs? Even their apperance?"
YOU: "how do you steal someone's appearance?"
CONTROL: "Clearly someone stole Theroux's! The man is dead yet here he is cutting a video!"
CONTROL: "I'll figure out the details soon. So close on cracking the VT mainframe, too."

PARTNER: "you heard Control's newest theory?"
YOU: "that the Theroux video's a fake?"
PARTNER: "yeah, that thing, but Control's wrong"
PARTNER: "I don't think the suicides really 'died,' in the real sense of the word"
YOU: "they faked their death?"
PARTNER: "Theroux should be dead but he's can still record, Elle should be dead but she can still text"
PARTNER: "maybe they really did find life after death, you know, lol"
PARTNER: "like, it kind of feels like I get it now... if I unfocus my eyes a bit"
YOU: "you've been reading too many of those Orion Devout pamphlets"
PARTNER: "maybe lol"
PARTNER: "what did you do to Lang btw?"
YOU: "no clue"
PARTNER: "they're trying to tell me to cut contact with you, just thought you should know"

CONTROL: "Liisten up. I have one last job for you."
YOU: "why's it the last job?"
CONTROL: "Because after you run it, I'll have it all figured out. The mystery is almost allllmost solved. I feel it."
CONTROL: "Are you up for another visit to the Orion Devout compound?"
YOU: "maybe. but what good will it do? there's nothing there, even underground"
CONTROL: "I have a plan. If you're in I just need to convince Goodwin. Lang is in. You'll all be going, the three of you."

PARTNER: "lol you realllly spooked Lang, that coward"
PARTNER: "they're refusing to come unless you're out"
YOU: "I talked to them this morning, they asked some questions but I don't know what set them off"
PARTNER: "who even KNOWS with them, told you they were awful to work with"

CONTROL: "Listen, I need you to follow my instructions on this one. Even if they sometimes might not make sense."
CONTROL: "Kind of like the Orion guys, eh? You are my hands, so you shouldn't mind if you don't know what the brain is doing."
YOU: "let me guess, Lang insisted?"
CONTROL: "Well... Yes. Goodwin told you that?"
YOU: "it wasn't hard to figure out"
CONTROL: "It doesn't matter. The only way I can convince Lang to go if you don't get the whole picture. Do you mind?"
YOU: "sounds like I don't have much of a choice"
CONTROL: "I'm drafting this whole operation in my head now."
CONTROL: "You'll be the first to enter, because you've been there before."
CONTROL: "Lang will be behind you. Goodwin comes last."
CONTROL: "If I told you to go back there and head back to the hidden entrance, you could do that?"
YOU: "yes."
CONTROL: "Oookay! The timing is important. Take the last train, Washingtion Station stop. You should arrive right before midnight."
YOU: "I'll be there"
CONTROL: "Good boy. This is embarassing; I'm giddy like a schoolgirl. I'm so close I can taste it!"
CONTROL: "Theroux, or whoever is behind all this... I'll know your plan soon!"

PARTNER: "you in yet?"

PARTNER: "were you tailed on your way over?"
YOU: "not that I know of"
PARTNER: "they're swarming me, gonna take every trick in the book to lose these guys"

YOU: "hey, there's a bit of a problem"
CONTROL: "Oh?"
YOU: "this place is different"
YOU: "it's empty, like it's been cleaned out"
CONTROL: "Interesting play, but I anticipated it. Don't worry about it for now and continue as normal."

YOU: "I'm in."
CONTROL: "Take the second-to-last left on this hall."

CONTROL: "There should be a door on the right at the end of this hall. That's a storage room. Go inside."

PARTNER: "don't forget to give me the signal"
YOU: "when?"
PARTNER: "oh, right"
PARTNER: "dude how did you sneak in here? the security on this place is insane"
YOU: "when I went in there was no one there"
PARTNER: "lucky bastard"
PARTNER: "hold a sec, I might have to start playing rough"

CONTROL: "Okay, they're on to Goodwin. I think Vertigo's eye is elsewhere right now. Exit the store room and go the room at the end of the hall"
YOU: "roger"
CONTROL: "Stay put there until I tell you."
CONTROL: "And whatever you do, don't go out the other door in the monitor room until you hear from Lang."
YOU: "Lang's supposed to be in touch? they blocked me"

YOU: "Control? still nothing from Lang"
CONTROL: "Give me one second. There's been a complication."

PARTNER: "the signal? please hurry"
YOU: "I'm stuck in some monitor room... haven't heard from Control or Lang"
PARTNER: "ok, ok, just give me the signal ASAP"
